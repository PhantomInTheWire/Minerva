#### **Abstract**

It is a well-established fact how the digital media and the technological platforms hold the power to develop the narrative of entire societies towards a particular issue. This narrative based on the masses can lead to inclusivity as well as the exclusivity of the issue to sociocultural ideologies the dictate the dynamics of a society. Thus, the study of digital media plays a major role in issues encompassing gender representation. Gender inequality in terms of digital accessibility remains to be a pressing issue at hand with alarming numbers even in this day and age of digitization. Women and non-binary communities face a great lack of access of digital devices and internet services. Stereotypical and restrictive images continue to exist, adding to social pressures and impeding real progress toward gender justice. While some platforms may support progressive narratives, others—often in the name of humor—continue damaging stereotypes, which results in unequal attention to challenges particular to gender. Gender nonconforming communities have especially showed the need for transparent and safe environment for digital gender representation. This paper implores all the paradigms related to the difficulties in gender representation due to the conventional socio-cultural ideas of the society and how it still affects the world in the digital age. In this study a systematic survey was conducted to determine the exposure of people to gender specific issues through digital media and technological channels including social media platforms, dating apps and cinema. Additionally, they were asked to describe their portrayal and how they perceive gender specific issues.

#### **Introduction**

#### **1.1 Overview**

Since the dawn of the new technical era with digitization being the new normal, the accessibility of digital devices and internet is now turning out to be a fundamental need of any individual. The digital divide describes the gap between people who have access to affordable, reliable internet service (Taylor, 2024). Though the governments around the world have been working needlessly to reduce this digital divide. The access to digital devices to different genders has been another story all together (The Stage Has Been Set for Gender Equity in Digital India, n.d.). While there is no official data it is expected that the divide between the gender conforming and the gender non-conforming community is comparatively humongous. This poor accessibility of digital devices results in poor representation on technological platforms.

Media in its various forms have become an integral part of our lives. The issues related to media, identity and gender are integral to the discipline of media and gender studies. Digital representations play an important role in producing sociocultural pressures. Despite social and legal progress in civil rights, restrictive gender-based representations appear to be still very pervasive in some contexts (Santoniccolo et al., 2023).

# **1.2 Importance**

Current digital media platforms represent the duality of modernism and conventional socio-cultural ideologies towards gender representation. Where some see it as a necessity, others use it for their humor. This results in disparity towards the highlighting of gender specific issues. As there is already a miniature gender representation especially for the non-binary community the issues raised by members of the communities are generally neglected and trolled for their mere digital presence.

Conventional ideology prevents free exchange of ideas highlighting the issues of the various gender communities. Whereas the modernist ideology requires the free and safe flow of such issues and ideas. This duality is the reason for most conflicts and controversies that we witness in this day and age. India proves to be one such prime example which clearly experiences the conflicts between the conventional socio-cultural ideology which describe the family structure as being formed by the inclusion of only the combination of males and females. Whereas the modernist ideology is trying to bring in a paradigm shift in the countries' social as well as constitutional structure.

#### **1.3 Objective**

This study investigates the experiences of women and non-binary groups in relation to the digital media. More specifically, it examines their access to such digital spaces, their picture in such arenas, and the effects of gender norms in giving relevant opportunities to ensure diversity in such areas and create safe spaces for these marginalized communities. This study also aims to assist the understanding of the digitized societal perceptions of gender in empowering more than only the academia but general public as well.

#### **1.3 Problem Statement**

Leaders from developed and emerging economies alike are expressing their concerns over the high digital gender inequality gap that persists within our societies. This highlights the persistent digital media access and participation gaps within the communities of women and non-binary-described individuals caused by cultural gender stereotypes and other social factors that impede their involvement in the digital world.

#### **1.5 Chapterization**

 Chapter 2 of this research paper provides a comprehensive literature review focusing on India's digital media landscape. It begins with an exploration of representation of various gender identities in the present media especially in the Indian context. The discussion extends to the global media, elucidating its size and sentiment towards representation of various genderbased identities, and the prominence of key media houses and corporations. Notably, the dominance of mainstream media in defining what is culturally acceptable. Overall, this chapter does a comprehensive analysis of India's digital media landscape.

 Chapter 3 examines both India's and global digital media Industry through a very detailed survey of young Indians, while they were aware of various issues pertaining to various gender minorities and women, they had yet to see any meaningful change being brought forth by mainstream cinema houses, media outlets and other giant mass media corporations. This seems to suggest that Indians are ready for a change, but the media is not.

 Chapter 4 presents the conclusion of our study, the global challenges of digital accessibility and gender stereotypes towards women and non-binary communities. Some platforms have been known to present progressive narratives, but some have also been opaque leading to limited inclusive representation. Our survey indicates what social media and dating applications or cinema portray regarding gender-related issues and stresses the need for fairness, openness, and security in cyberspace. The chapter brings these issues together by calling for a radical shift in the design of the digital space towards one that is inhibitive of gender inequality in every socio-cultural context.

#### **Literature Review**

#### **2.1 Historical references of gender references**

#### *2.1.1 Gender*

Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, expressions and identities of girls, women, boys, men, and gender diverse people (Government of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institutes, Institute of Gender and Health, 2023). Gender is a property that helps people perceive themselves and their roles in society in various ways. Due to these difference in perspectives to perceive themselves and the society, the issues and the way to represent these issues vary for the various genders.

#### *2.1.2 Non-binary Gender roles*

Non-binary gender identities or gender non-conforming identities refer to the identities that do not fit into the society's conventional idea of binary gender identities of "male" and "female" or "masculinity" and "femineity". Some the non-binary gender identities include "Genderqueer", "Agender", "Bigender", "Genderfluid".

#### *2.1.3 Evolution of gender roles*

Historically, most cultures have constructed their societies around two distinct gender roles corresponding to the biological male and female sexes. However, roles could vary significantly cross-culturally. For example, the Arapesh people of New Guinea saw men and women as having similar roles in society and being equally responsible for raising children (Payne, 2024). In accordance to this rigidity employed by most of the cultures in the world the roles for the binary genders Male and Female were also strictly defined. With most of the cultures believing in the transitional gender roles which define that the two genders may devote different time to work, home and family.

Evolution of gender roles

# *2.1.4 Gender representation*

Gender representation refers to the examination of how different genders are portrayed in media and communication and cultural products including various forms of art, literature, advertising and social media. Because representation matters, but always in the context of other aspects of identity — race, ethnicity, class, age, sexuality and disability all intersect with gender too. Gender representation has changed over the years, influenced by feminist movements and calls for LGBTQ+ representation and diversity.

#### *2.1.5 Socio-cultural norms*

Socio-cultural norms play a crucial role in shaping gender roles and representations within society. These norms define the unwritten rules that provide dictate the dynamics of gender roles and representation in a society. Most common socio-cultural norms include the rejection of gender identities that challenge the conventional binary gender roles. These norms favor the dominance of the binary gender roles and are also inclined highly towards the patriarchal gender ideologies that dictate that men are supposed to work externally to earn bread for the family whereas women are expected to nurture the family.

#### **2.2 Representation of gender in digital media**

#### *2.2.1 Power of media channels*

In every culture the narrative we tell and are told have extreme powers to create prejudice beliefs. The ideas that we hear from closed ones or on a daily basis have the most power to influence our own ideas. This inception of ideas through harmless channels of information have the power to control the masses. Throughout the history we have observed that emperors and governments have always tried to censor media to promote their own propaganda and prevent any rebellions. The feeling of anti-nationalism or rebellions are not native to all, for most this feeling is instigated by authors, poets and orators who possess the power to provide one of the many perspectives to a situation. Hence M&E holds the utmost power to influence the rise or demise of a particular ideology.

#### *2.2.2 Digital media on Gender representation*

In the modern world where most of the information that circulates around the globe uses digital media as it's medium, it becomes imperative to study digital media in order to study the factors influencing the gender dynamics of the global societies. The subject of how infrastructures and technology relate to gender studies is a question that remains to be raised in the research area, but also in the sociological, civil and political arena (Popa & Gavriliu, 2015). Thus, representation of various genders throughout digital media influences how much familiarity the masses would have with the gender and what stereotypes would be equipped to identify and characterize the gender.

#### *2.2.3 Digital divide*

The digital divide is the gap created by unequal access to modern telecommunications technology among different demographic groups and regions (Taylor, 2024). As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-21), only one in three women in India (33%) have ever used the internet, compared to more than half (57%) of men (The Stage Has Been Set for Gender Equity in Digital India, n.d.). This data portrays how the access to technology is highly skewed towards to men in India. This data is only recorded for the digital divide for the binary genders and no such reliable data has been recorded for the study of gender divide among people belonging to gender non-conforming community. This lack of record is in itself a statement that provides insights regarding the amount of digital divide for the non-binary community in comparison to the binary community.

# **2.3 Challenges in gender representation on technological platforms**

#### *2.3.1 Underrepresentation and Marginalization*

Underrepresentation refers to the insufficient visibility or distorted portrayal of certain genders including females, non=binary individuals, and LGBTQIA+ communities. It has been observed that the representation is highly skewed towards the patriarchal society which restricts the representation of all the other genders. According to reports by X one of the world's most famous social media platform the number of accounts registered as males account for 68.66% of the total account base whereas only 31.34% of the account base identifies themselves as female in 2024. This data does not even include the percentage of users that identify themselves apart from the conventional binary gender system. This is a direct consequence of the fact that most of the administration of these digital media giants is managed by binary individuals which results in lack of perspective for representational needs of the non-binary individuals.

#### *2.3.2 Algorithmic bias*

Gender-neutral internet searches yield results that nonetheless produce male-dominated output, finds a new study by a team of psychology researchers (Communications, n.d.). Most of the searching and recommendations algorithms equip AI to enhance the efficiency and results of the searches. AI models ae trained on available data and thus can have innumerable inaccuracies for a skewed dataset. Most of the datasets used in these models are classified for at most 3 genders including only males, females, and others which is used as an umbrella term for all the gender identities. This biasness in dataset results in biasness in algorithms which results in insufficient reach of UGC by non-binary individuals.

#### **2.4 Representation in Cinema and News**

#### *2.4.1 Gender stereotypes and on-screen narratives*

As the ideas of the non-binary gender theory challenges the conventional ideas of the global society, the cinema was also for a long period of time produced narratives supporting these ideologies. Many stereotypical ideas were implanted in the minds of the masses for various genders apart from the binary genders. Stereotypes related to the ideas that gay individuals are bullied in high schools for identifying with the "Gay" gender identity. Females identifying with the gender identity of "Lesbian" had a certain way of dressing. Several other stereotypes were also etched into the minds of the masses. At the end of the 20th century globalization represented the interests of free markets for everyone. This transition and the use of the nation as a family paradigm places women in a subordinate position, limited to domestic and maternal roles (Portrayal of Gender Stereotype in Bollywood Cinema: An Analytical Study, 2023). In the recent years of OTT platforms, the representation of gender nonconforming individuals has been handled with care. The film industry around the globe is witnessing a rise in number of non-binary actors, writers, directors and other various roles. These increased opportunities to non-binary individuals in cinema directly affects the GRI of the industry.

#### *2.4.2 Gender inequality in mainstream news media*

News outlets constitute an important apparatus for molding public opinion and setting social standards. Women, however, remain marginalized both in the content of news and in the structures producing it. Empirical evidence suggests that women are invariably less visualized, spoken about, or considered as authorities. Only 24% of news subjects – the people interviewed or whom the news is about – were female (6th GLOBAL MEDIA MONITORING PROJECT, 2020). This gap is present even when it comes to the hierarchy of the institutions that produce news, as only a tiny percentage of women is seen in senior management positions. Moreover, the media phenomena often contribute to stereotyping and discrimination against certain genders. The women politicians and public figures are the ones who are haters, as they have to endure more criticism of their looks and private lives than men ever do. The coverage women receive in news reports often contains maternal emphasis which perpetuates gender bias by creating an image of a woman who is a mother, failure or interference in profession, while men are mostly created with a focus on their career accomplishment.

# **2.5 Representation in Social Media and video games**

#### *2.5.1 Gender representation in video games*

The gender representations and relations within the video game industry have drawn negative critiques for a long time. Traditionally, the women characters in video games have been limited in number or portrayed in ways that are stereotypical and at times, very sexualized. In a study by Downs and Smith (2010), it was found that popular video game female characters were likely to be eroticized, dressed in skimpy clothes, and having impossible body shape ratios than male characters. Also, gender disparity is seen from the audience towards the main characters in a video game, where male characters are the protagonists in most cases even in cases where there are some female characters, very few, and perhaps only one female character leads the game. This skewness can also be problematic as it may imply that roles that are heroic or daring are largely associated with male characters. The concern, however, is not just with the representation of characters, but also the players and the industry connected to this form of entertainment. Overall, the results show marked differences in the way males and females are presented in video games both in terms of sheer amount of appearance in games as well as the way in which their sexuality is represented. In short, females occur far less frequently in video games and are more likely to be shown in a hypersexual light than are males (Edward Paul Downs, 2004).

#### *2.5.2 Gender biases on social networks*

Gender stereotypes persist in social media and are further influenced by algorithms and the influencers. They carry out this purpose by enhancing individuals' experiences with the platform as they have these any other designed experiences, which include search, advertising, and recommendations that are based on pre-existing stereotypes (Eg et al., 2022) . This leads to negative consequences for the image of women, through as seen the reinforcing of body image barriers and stereotypes about women's occupations (Glotfelter, 2019).

Simple bias in the algorithm is not the only component as it also occurs that women and anyone else who is not identified as male experience harassment online in greater proportions than the general male population. These issues are often exacerbated by algorithms and reporting technologies that do not work. These challenges require strategies that tackle bias and discrimination, education initiatives, accountability by these platforms or actors and content stewardship. This is important to create an almost equitable space.

#### **Analysis**

#### **3.1 Methodology and Variables**

The problem statement for our term paper is "How conventional socio-cultural norms lead to challenges in gender representation across digital media and technological platforms." Thus, it was a necessity for us to gain insights regarding public opinion on the current familial structure and imposed cultural restrictions as well as what could be the future of gender representation norms in terms of digital media paradigm.

We employed a google form based quantitative questionnaire to gather data from individuals across diverse age groups, educational and professional backgrounds, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of influential factors determining gender representation in digital media. We shared the google form to a total of around 180 to 220 respondents in order to get a concrete dataset to perform further analysis.

Although the participants were chosen at random, a large chunk of the sample space consist of students currently in various schools and various colleges along with a very few falling in the age group of 25-30 years. A large chunk of people in the sample space belong to gender conforming community i.e. with majority respondents being male or female and very few belonging to the non-binary community. Following this most of the respondents identify their sexual identities as heterosexual and a very few were oriented towards LGBTQIA+ sexuality.

After collecting the demographic data from the respondent, we acquired data concerning how people much people observe and consume gender specific content through different channels of digital media and technological platforms. Starting with cinema and streaming platforms and moving all the way to representation on dating platforms.

Afterwards we collected public opinion regarding how all the form of representation that we enquired about earlier in the questionnaire are affected by the conventional sociocultural norms due to the orthodox familial structure in India.

Although our survey has its own strong points, unfortunately we were not able to tackle some of its drawbacks. One limitation is that the sample space will have a major chunk of respondents in the age group of 18-24 years, this age group does not quite understand the policy formation and legal advocacy of a society and thus cannot quite comprehend the impact of socio-cultural norms that dominated the societal ideology. Another limitation we encountered is that the sample space will be of college students majorly oriented as heterosexuals who do not face much issues in representation of ideas on technological platforms and thus do not notice and observe much discrimination regarding gender representation. We also were unable to get much responses from people in the age group of 25-30 years who have much greater experience in understanding the challenges posed by conventional ideologies .Thus, our findings might not represent everyone. So, while our analysis can provide us with valuable insights, we cannot claim it to be everyone's perspective.

#### **3.2 Results**

The pie chart illustrates the demographic distribution of 185 individuals. Notably, the largest proportion, comprising 95.1%, falls within the age bracket of 18-24 years, i.e. respondents belonging to colleges or freshman professionals. Additionally, a smaller fraction, approximately 3% of the sample is aged between 16-18 years, signifying a significant representation from this age group. This diversification in the age group helps us in determining the valuable insights of especially the youth of the country who have currently begun to form connections with people of various demographic. Thus their ideology towards free gender representation is formulated maturely by continuous observations in digital media as well as physical connections.

The pie chart represents that majority of the individuals, approximately 64% in the sample space identify themselves as males. Whereas 34.5% of the individuals identify themselves as females. Only a very small fraction of individuals identify as Non-binary/ Genderqueer. This pie chart is a very bold indication of the gender based digital divide in India.

# **Figure 4**

The survey results indicate that a significant portion, accounting for 83.3% of the respondents, reported being oriented with heterosexual orientation. This suggests that a majority of views for further questions are from the persepective of the heterosexual community individuals . Only a small portion of individuals, accounting for 5.5% of the total space either orient themselves towards LGBTQIA+ sexual orientation or prefer not to disclose their orientation.

This bar chart shows the various digital media channels that the respondents engage with in order to consume information about the local and global affairs, and for entertainment purposes. Social media, at 68.5% constitutes as the most engaged digital media channel for the respondents followed by OTT platforms and TV shows contributing 62.6% and 52.6%. This high numbers indicate that the respondents are very much familial with the modern digital media channels and observe the activities on these channels on a regular basis.

#### Pie chart representing responses for survey question 6

The chart presents diverse perspectives on the representation of women in mainstream movies and TV shows including OTT streaming platforms

- Excellent: 14.3%
- Good: 38.9%
- Fair: 35%
- Poor: 11.8%

Though the majority of the respondents believe that the representation of women in mainstream movies and TV shows is Good. But a fairly large chunk of the respondents do not completely align with this idea as they seem to believe that the representation of women in cinema is only fair up to an extent and not ideal.

Pie chart representing responses for survey question 7

The survey points out how the majority of the sample space i.e. 67% has observed the presence of gender norms and stereotypes of their culture reflected in cinema. A significantly large portion accounting for around 31% of the total respondents also have observed such norms and stereotypes restrict free gender representation in cinema often. This indicated that socio-cultural norms do abrupt the free gender representation and influence the gender stereotypes in cinema.

This chart represents the distribution of social media platforms that the respondents have observed to have to most discussion concerning gender equality and representation. According to this chart Instagram tops the list with 46.3% of the respondents finding it to be a platform for safe and free gender representation. Following it Meta is at second with 20.7% of the respondents finding it a safe place for gender discussions.

#### **Figure 9**

The survey results suggest that a significant majority with 57.6% of respondents do not engage in content generated by creators of the gender non-conforming community. This suggests that the majority of the people may not be able to resonate with gender specific issues. Though a notable chunk does consume gender specific content created by non-binary individuals.

#### **Figure 10**

Pie chart representing responses for survey question 10

![](_page_30_Figure_4.jpeg)

Almost majority of the respondents have observed online harassment towards influencers from non-binary community occasionally. Also a total of 24.1% of the respondents report to witness this online harassment frequently. This indicates the patriarchal nature of the digital media where the gender non-binary ideas are continuously revolted against and are harassed.

Pie chart representing responses for survey question 11

The majority of the respondents, accounting for 61.6% of the total provide neutral insights towards their opinion on belief in advertisements on social media and streaming platforms feature diverse gender identities. But following this proportion around 22.1% of the respondents disagree with the statement and believe that the diverse gender identities are not justifiably represented in advertisements on digital media platforms.

# **Figure 12**

Around 54 % of the respondents have noticed gender non-conforming characters in video games. Whereas al large chunk of 46% of the respondents have not noticed any gender non-conforming individuals which indicates the skewedness of online games in portrayal of non-binary individuals as characters.

Only 18.7% of the total respondents are confident that they have witnessed genderbased discrimination or harassment on online gaming platforms. 36.9% of the respondents are surprisingly not sure of the above. This maybe cause of the reason that online gaming platforms do not specifically ask for information regarding one's gender and sexual orientation which make the gender attribute of the player anonymous for most of the cases.

A large portion of the individuals have not used any of the dating apps in their life time.

Only 30.5% of the individuals have had the experience of using any dating applications or sites.

Out of the 30.5% of all the users that have used dating applications 62.3% believe that the dating platforms are to a certain extent inclusive towards non-binary individuals. Whereas 27.5% do not believe that dating platforms provide any kind of inclusivity of gender non-binary individuals. This indicates that while the dating applications are trying to be more inclusive towards the individuals of gender non-binary community, they have still not achieved the ideal state of inclusivity for free and safe representation.

### **Figure 16**

The majority of the respondents around 91.2% of the respondents believe that the cultural background i.e. the socio-cultural norms instigated in one's ideology have a bound on one's perception of gender roles. Out of these 91.2%, 36.5% strongly agree with this idea of how cultural values dominate the gender ideology of an individual.

This question is similar to the previous question where we have asked the respondent's opinion if the perception of gender non-conforming, transgender and non-binary individuals is heavily influenced by the socio-cultural upbringing of an individual. To a surprise 90.6% of the individuals agree with this statement.

#### **Figure 18**

This question determines whether the ideologies portrayed in the digital media do have real world impact on the societal attitudes towards gender representation for all communities. As the majority of the respondents agree with this opinion we can confirm that in order to provide safer environment for gender representation digital media needs to be studied and examined.

#### **Figure 19**

This question ensures that improvement in gender representation policies in the digital media paradigm has a real world impact which can lead to broader social change. A huge chunk of the respondents with 51.8% do believe that inclusion of all the genders in digital media and technological platforms will result in better communication of issues of the unrepresented gender marginalised community.

#### **Conclusion**

#### **4.1 Conclusion**

The research highlights the growing popularity of social media and OTT services as the dominant modes of digital interaction. This induced portion corroborates the argument offered in the research abstract concerning the role of digital media in changing the dynamics of people's relations. The constant use of these channels also means that they have a great ability to influence the audience's views on a variety of issues, such as gender. As a result of these usage patterns, one of the most important aspects of the ability to use these products is the careful examination of the representations of gender on them. One of the reasons is their ability to inform and shape attitudes regarding inclusivity and diversity in societies.

While respondents expressed moderate satisfaction with the portrayal of women in digital media, a substantial proportion raised concerns regarding the quality and depth of representation, indicating a need for improvement. More critically, the survey revealed significant dissatisfaction with the representation of gender non-conforming individuals, highlighting a pressing need for more nuanced and authentic portrayals. This finding aligns with the abstract's emphasis on the challenges faced by non-binary communities and their call for safer, more representative digital spaces. The disconnect between the perceived lack of cultural reflection in cinema and the lived experiences of individuals further emphasizes the existing gaps in accurate representation.

The instances of gender discrimination in online gaming and the sense of exclusivity in the use of dating apps highlight the pressing risk of overcoming systemic barriers and promoting safe spaces. The media survey shows how the actual world slaves or reinforces such attitudes – especially as regards gender portrayals in the media. Significantly, the widely prevalent idea that better representation will inevitably result in social transformation creates a solid case for why there is a need for more representative media. This belief is similar to the core aspect of the study, which presents digital media in a very positive light portraying it as a conduit for promoting gender equality.

To sum up, the results from the survey endorse the key issues raised in the research abstract to a significant degree. They show how digital media has changed the dynamics of gender perceptions, pointing out the existing imbalance in gender representation and stressing the cultural aspect in appreciating these changes. This research shift hints at the possibilities that digital media presents in these contemporary times to enhance gender representation and pave way for social change.

#### **4.2 Limitations and further scope for study**

Although our survey has its own strong points, unfortunately we were not able to tackle some of its drawbacks. One limitation is that the sample space will have a major chunk of respondents in the age group of 18-24 years, this age group is generally more open minded and naive towards the struggles of women just a few decades ago. Another limitation we encountered is that the sample space will be of college students majorly oriented as heterosexuals who do not face many issues in representation of ideas on technological platforms and thus do not notice and observe much discrimination regarding gender representation.

One of the other issue that we faced was that all of survey data points that we gathered from previous studies especially for India cannot be considered very much reliable as the last census was conducted in 2011 in India. A time gap of 13 years is wide enough to encounter for major changes in the demographic data of a region.
