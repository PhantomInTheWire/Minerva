# **1. Introduction**

# **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a clear and detailed description of the requirements for the Interflow software system. Interflow is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to provide virtual meeting capabilities similar to Google Meet and Zoom, but with enhanced multilingual features, including real-time voice translation and a multilingual whiteboard. This SRS document serves as a guide for all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and end-users, to ensure that the system is developed according to agreed-upon requirements.

# **1.2 Scope**

Interflow aims to facilitate seamless online meetings, webinars, and virtual conferences with real-time language translation and collaboration tools. Key features include:

- Multilingual voice translation
- Multilingual whiteboard collaboration
- Real-time captions and subtitles
- Low latency and high-quality audio/video
- Host and participant management tools
- Integration with existing scheduling systems

This SRS focuses on the functional and non-functional requirements, design constraints, and the interface specifications that will govern the development of Interflow.

This SRS is structured to provide a clear outline of the system's overall description, specific requirements, diagrams and models, and validation criteria. It concludes with a summary of IEEE compliance and outlines next steps in the development process.

# **2. Overall Description**

# **2.1 Product Perspective**

Interflow is envisioned as a standalone web-based and mobile-accessible platform that integrates with existing scheduling services (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook). It operates in a cloud environment, leveraging WebRTC for real-time communication. The system depends on stable internet connectivity, server infrastructure for media processing, and third-party translation APIs for multilingual support.

### **2.2 Product Functions**

- 1. **User Authentication**: Users (Admins, Hosts, Participants) can create accounts, log in, and manage their credentials.
- 2. **Meeting Management**:
	- **Create, Join, and Schedule Meetings**: Hosts can schedule future meetings and invite participants.
	- **Live Meeting Control**: Start, pause, end, and record sessions.
- 3. **Multilingual Support**:
	- **Real-Time Voice Translation**: Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and language translation.
	- **Multilingual Whiteboard**: Collaborative whiteboard that supports text in multiple languages.
- 4. **Audio/Video Conferencing**:
	- **High-Quality AV Streaming**: Low-latency, adaptive bitrate, and encryption.
	- **Participant Controls**: Mute/unmute, toggle video, share screen, and raise hand.
- 5. **Collaboration Features**:
	- **Chat with Translation**: Participants can send chat messages that can be automatically translated.
	- **File Sharing**: Upload and download relevant documents.
- 6. **Administrative Tools**:
- **Domain Configuration**: Admins can manage organizational settings.
- **Usage Analytics**: Tracking of usage patterns, meeting duration, and user engagement.

### **2.3 User Characteristics**

- **Admins**: Responsible for configuring domain-wide settings, user management, and security policies.
- **Hosts**: Create and manage meetings, control meeting settings (e.g., translations, whiteboard access), and moderate participants.
- **Participants**: Join meetings, interact via audio/video, chat, shared files, and multilingual whiteboard.

# **2.4 Constraints**

- **Network Requirements**: Requires stable broadband internet connection for optimal performance.
- **Platform Limitations**: Must support a variety of devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- **Security**: Must adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) and use secure protocols (TLS, SRTP).

# **2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**

- Assumes availability of robust cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Depends on third-party APIs for translation and speech recognition.
- Assumes that end-users have compatible hardware (microphone, camera) and browsers that support WebRTC.

# **3. Specific Requirements**
