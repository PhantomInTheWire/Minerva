## Overview

Minerva is an AI-driven learning platform leveraging advanced RAG techniques and multi-modal processing to enable dynamic educational content generation and analysis. The system utilizes a distributed architecture with specialized AI agents for different computational tasks, backed by a robust data processing pipeline.

## Features

### Core Features

1. **Notebook Creation and Management**
    - Users can create and organize notebooks, uploading and managing a variety of materials such as:
        - PDF files
        - Picture(.jpeg, .png, .jpg, .svg, .gif)
        - Markdown/text/LaTeX/Source Code files
        - YouTube video links
        - Raw MP4/MP3 files
        - .docx, .pptx
        - .zip for bundled files
    - The system categorizes materials by topic and document type, storing them in a PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval.
    - These notebooks can then be referenced to access common resources
2. **AI Agent Interaction**
    - Users interact with an AI **agents** capable of:
        - Querying the database to answer questions based on the user's materials.
        - Generating quizzes tailored to the user's knowledge and tracking performance.
        - Recommending areas of improvement and creating personalized learning roadmaps.
        - Crafting custom video lectures and generating flashcards for specific topics.
        - Providing answers to general subject-related queries.
        - Web search agent using serper api that can search and scrape the web just in case context is too limited to answer the users queries.
        - Generating diagrams that can summarize user uploaded content through mind maps or become roadmaps to help user learn new topics or allow user to create their own powerful visual mind maps. 
3. **Notebook Sharing**
    - Enable seamless sharing of notebooks with other users to foster collaboration and collective learning.
4. **Visualization Tools**
    - Create dynamic mind maps and learning roadmaps with the help of:
        - **MermaidJS** for interactive visualizations.
        - **PlantUML** for detailed diagrams.
        - **MarkMapJS*(https://markmap.js.org/repl)
        - **Excalidraw**(https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/)
5. **Spaced Repetition for Flashcards**
    - Boost memorization efficiency by implementing AI-optimized intervals for flashcard reviews.
    - COMIC-ify* based

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The application comprises several components that work together to provide an intelligent and interactive learning experience:

- **Frontend**: ReactJS and NextJS
- **Backend**:
	- FastAPI/Python for AI stuff
	- Actix/rust crates for performance intensive video and data processing tasks
	- nodejs and expressjs/nestjs for excalidraw integration. 
	- Golang cause Priyanshu

- **Database**:
	- PostgreSQL for storing categorized learning materials
	- Redis for caching
	- RedisJSON for any random noSQL usecase
	- redis streams for Event Driven Queues
- **AI/ML Framework**: combination of different llms including but limited to gemini-2.0-flash(regular and thinking), gemini-1.5-pro, llama3.3(groq), deepseek-v3 depending on speed and task complexity
- **Visualization Tools**: Integration of Mermaid.js and PlantUML for rendering visual elements.

### High-Level Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**
    - Users upload learning materials, which are categorized and stored in the PostgreSQL database.
2. **AI Interaction**
- **Question Answering Agent**: Provides concise and relevant responses to user queries.(based on the lightRAG or LazyRag Approach, probably have to implement the whole thing in rust cause raw python implementations are performance bottlenecks)
- **Quiz Generation Agent**: Designs customized quizzes based on user materials.
- **Slide/Video Generation Agent**: Generates video lectures tailored to specific topics. The videos will be FIRESHIP style
- **Flashcard Creation Agent**: Produces flashcards optimized for memorization.(same use comic-ify service)
- **Roadmap Agent**: Creates personalized learning roadmaps and visually appealing mind maps.(must be created in three visual formats, MarkMap, excalidraw and mermaid)
- **Mindmap Agent**: Creates mindmaps based on uploaded notes/resources.(same as roadmap 3 visuals)
- **Research Agent**: An agent that can access the internet, any of the other agents can call this if they find their context lacking and ask for direction.(probably deepseek v3/ groq llama 3.3 and serper api)
3. **Subject Overview**
	- Detailed notes created from user uploaded contents(essentially users own notes but slightly more verbose and pretty eye candy ðŸ¤©!)
	- Sectional Revision points
	- Sectional Quiz
1. . **Collaboration and Sharing**
    - Shared notebooks enable multiple users to contribute and collaborate effectively.
2. **Visualization**
    - Mind maps and roadmaps are dynamically generated using Mermaid.js and PlantUML, providing a clear overview of topics and their relationships.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

#### Phase 1.1: Basic Chat Infrastructure

1. Build the notebook creation and material categorization system.
2. Enable preprocessing methods to convert regular text into markdown semantically. 
3. Build the LightRAG/LazyGraphRag prototype using existing implementation
4. Set up PostgreSQL database to store and manage user materials.
5. Develop AI agent functionality for querying and basic question answering using different RAG techniques.
4. Extend text upload to virtually any file type that can be converted to
txt

#### Phase 1.2: Better Chat and AI Overview

1. Implement better preprocessing
   - For files in pdf format (or pdf friendly formats like .docx or .pptx) add a different pre processing layer that semantically converts them into markdown and JSON for llm processing.
   - This will be useful for designing the next overview feature

2. Develop Sectional Overview
   - Organize and optimize the markdown using smaller specialized models and make it look eye candy on the frontend.
   - Add sectional quizes and revision checkpoints etc to help track user progress.
	- The API for this would be GraphQL instead of REST since this is something that must be queried on demand as the contents being retrieved can be large, and the query responds with  nested JSON objects.
   - It should have a optional chat bot pop up on the right/left side bar that can take into context anything the user selects and doubts

#### Phase 1.3: Quiz Engines and personalisation

1. Genere Quiz based on uploaded content
   - should include single correct and multiple correct questions
   - It should have context on the kind of questions that the user got correct or wrong in the overview section
   - A detailed analysis report/ dash board is expected.
   - A lot of this can be outsorced to n8n selfhosted platform.
   - Anything the user gets wrong must be stoed for future reference by other services(quiz service itself, overview service |might highlight important parts| or the video generation service.)

#### Phase 1.4: Extending Chat interface

1. Add an AI agent workflow with acess to open internet
   - serper with google api or opensourced perplexity alts
   - acess to reddit via google/serper search apis
   - acess to youtube search
   - all of this workflow can be outsorced to a self hosted n8n

#### Phase 1.5: Deploy

1. Try deploying to a self hosted VPS using coolify
   - configure the existing ci/cd github actions pipeline
   - add telegram/email bots for notifications
   - probably use gcp or azure(aws ui looks horrible and digital ocean doesn't have a free tier)
   - figure out how to deal with minerva docker-compose madness
   - figure out how to deal with n8n docker-compose madness
   - if lucky combine the two into a single docker-compose or k8 cluster

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### Phase 2.1: Lazy Graph RAG Optimization
1. Make the RAG go fast
   - Implement neo4j integration for graph databses
   - Optimize semantic chunking and retrival strategies
   - Add a caching layer with Redis for frequent queries

2. Implement query optimization
   - Improve prompt button to improve user prompts
   - use groq with mixtral or llama 8b param model for this
   - make it smooth by using response streaming

#### Phase 2.2: Quiz Generation

1. Implement advanced quiz generation and performance analysis.
	- the questions user gets wrong in review section or quiz section will be permanently stored for review
	- Users mistakes will appear in a separate analysis section for review and revision.
	- eye candy Stats page in analytics section
	- this data will then be given to other services like roadmap, flash cards, videos.

#### Phase 2.3: Legacy Video Generation

1. Vedanta
   - add legacy vedanta code as a microservice to this
   - use moviepy and opencv to add effects, transitions etc to improve the experience
   - try to switch from google cloud tts to a whatever is faster and has decent quality out of unofficial tiktok tts api, turtle, suno.ai(bark2)

2. COMIC-ify
   - implement the comicify service(check github link in references)
   - improve upon existing codebase by shifiting from static themes to comic-ify generated themes

#### Phase 2.4: Flash Card Generation

1. Spaced Repetion
   - Implement ai based algo for spaced repetion based flashcards
   - [What is space repetion?](https://ncase.me/remember/)
   - [Open Spaced Repo](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition)
   - [spaced](https://github.com/lipanski/spaced)

2. Make them look good
   - either implement comic-ify or some other method to make them look good

#### Phase 2.5: New Video Generation Paradigmn

1. Implement video generation with fireship style for genz attention spans
   - [fireship](https://youtu.be/_rGXIXyNqpk?si=Yo-IOXu5Fjvn_Lh7)
   - Use movie.py and openv for custom filters and effects
   - [neural nine video editing tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2d1tYvTjRw)


#### Phase 2.6: MindMaps and FlowCharts

1. Generate Traditional MarkMap based mindmaps
   - they look like mind maps on whimsical
   - make sure the ui looks good

2. Generate MindMaps and FlowCharts that look hand drawn
   - Generate them in mermaid
   - conver to excalidraw json like objects
   - embed excalidraw board on the frontend
   - render in excalidraw board

3. Give the user ability to generate these in 2 ways
   1. prompting in context of uploaded documents
      - the user prompts the ai agent that generated and renders the mind map in whatever way they wany in context of uploaded documents
      - this query will be analyzed using Lazy RAG

   2. Visualise their own notes
      - The user picks one of their uploaded files and explores a full blown mind map of it
      - It can be either whimsical like using MarkMap or handwritten using excalidraw
      - The user can choose this based on their preference
